This is a Micro-Polling Website designed by Meet Patel, A website contains all the labs and assignments of the 
following subject which I had created using PHP, Javascript - react.js/vue.js, Ajax, MySQL, HTML and CSS. A 
website itself contains the interactive contents such as signup, login, creating user account. Implemented 
logics to specify errors and misinformation. This website has Questions of polls which users can answer and 
also create new ones by themselves after getting logged in.
